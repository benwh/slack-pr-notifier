# 2024-25 Best Practices Implementation

This document outlines specific 2024-25 best practices research findings that should be implemented for modern production deployment. Items in `docs/TODO.md` are excluded to avoid duplication.

## üîí Critical Security Improvements (2024-25 Standards)

### GitHub Webhooks Security (Industry Standard)
- [ ] **Async webhook processing** - GitHub has 10-second timeout, critical for reliability
- [ ] **Request validation middleware** - Prevent malformed payloads from crashing the service
- [ ] **Webhook replay protection** - Use X-GitHub-Delivery header to prevent duplicate processing
- [ ] **IP allowlisting** - Restrict webhooks to GitHub's published IP ranges (https://api.github.com/meta)
- [ ] **Event type validation** - Validate X-GitHub-Event header before processing

### Slack API Security (2024-25 Updates)
- [ ] **IP restrictions** - Configure Slack app IP restrictions for production use
- [ ] **Rate limiting compliance** - Respect Slack's updated rate limits (conversations.history changes May 2025)
- [ ] **Proper retry logic** - Handle transient Slack API failures with exponential backoff

### Google Cloud Security (2024-25 Features)
- [ ] **Firestore security rules** - Implement client-side access controls
- [ ] **Cloud Run private services** - Deploy as private services with restricted access
- [ ] **Binary Authorization** - Ensure only signed containers are deployed
- [ ] **Automatic security updates** - Enable Cloud Run managed security updates
- [ ] **Customer-Managed Encryption Keys** - For sensitive data at rest

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations (2024-25 Standards)

### Firestore Performance (Google's 2024-25 Recommendations)
- [ ] **500/50/5 traffic ramping** - Follow Google's recommended scaling pattern for new collections
- [ ] **Query performance monitoring** - Use new Query insights feature for optimization
- [ ] **Database location optimization** - Multi-region setup for high availability

### Container Security (2024-25 Docker Best Practices)
- [ ] **Distroless images** - Switch from Alpine to distroless for smaller attack surface
- [ ] **Multi-stage build optimization** - Reduce final image size by 60%+ as recommended
- [ ] **Regular vulnerability scanning** - Integrate Trivy or similar in CI/CD pipeline

## üìä Modern Observability (2024-25 Standards)

### Structured Logging Enhancement
- [ ] **Extend correlation ID usage** - Use correlation IDs in all service calls
- [ ] **Cloud Logging integration** - Leverage Google Cloud's structured logging
- [ ] **Request/response logging** - Log webhook payloads (sanitized) for debugging

### Monitoring & Alerting
- [ ] **Webhook processing metrics** - Track processing times and success rates
- [ ] **Error rate monitoring** - Alert on increased error rates
- [ ] **Business metrics** - Track PR notification success rates

## üèóÔ∏è Modern Architecture Patterns (2024-25 Go Best Practices)

### Reliability Patterns
- [ ] **Timeout configurations** - Proper timeouts for all external API calls
- [ ] **Circuit breaker pattern** - Prevent cascading failures
- [ ] **Health checks with dependencies** - Include Firestore and Slack API health

### Security Patterns
- [ ] **Input validation** - Comprehensive validation as per Go 2024-25 security guidelines
- [ ] **Type safety enforcement** - Leverage Go's strong typing for security
- [ ] **Encryption support** - Use Go's TLS and crypto packages for secure communication

## üöÄ Deployment & Operations (2024-25 Cloud Standards)

### CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] **Automated security scanning** - Container image vulnerability scanning
- [ ] **Multi-environment deployment** - Separate dev/staging/prod with proper promotion
- [ ] **Rollback mechanisms** - Quick rollback for failed deployments

### Production Readiness
- [ ] **Configuration validation** - Validate all environment variables at startup
- [ ] **Secrets management** - Use Google Secret Manager instead of environment variables
- [ ] **Resource limits** - Set appropriate CPU and memory limits for Cloud Run

## Implementation Priority for Webhook Applications

Based on 2024-25 research, these are prioritized for webhook processing applications:

### Phase 1: Critical for Reliability
1. **Async webhook processing** - Prevents GitHub timeout failures
2. **Request validation** - Prevents service crashes
3. **IP allowlisting** - Basic security requirement

### Phase 2: Production Security
1. **Firestore security rules** - Data access controls
2. **Cloud Run private services** - Network security
3. **Proper retry logic** - Handle API failures gracefully

### Phase 3: Modern Standards
1. **Distroless containers** - Reduced attack surface
2. **Binary Authorization** - Signed container deployment
3. **Comprehensive monitoring** - Operational visibility

## Key Differences from General TODO List

This document focuses specifically on:
- **Industry-standard security practices** discovered in 2024-25 research
- **Platform-specific optimizations** for GCP/GitHub/Slack
- **Modern container security** practices
- **Reliability patterns** specific to webhook processing

The general TODO list covers broader architectural improvements and feature enhancements that are not specific to 2024-25 best practices research.
