## Your task

We are developing a code change on this branch, and want to ensure that it meets our
standards.

Run the linting script, and collect the list of errors.

If the script reports no linting issues, then we're all done - no further action required!

Group them appropriately (e.g. if many appear to be from the same cause), and then work
through them methodically in a list, applying fixes to resolve the linter failure.

If any of the issues aren't reasonably straight-forward to resolve, e.g. may require
significant refactoring, then confirm with the user before proceeding with anything like
that.

Once you've made changes to resolve the issues, run the linter one final time to confirm the fixes.
