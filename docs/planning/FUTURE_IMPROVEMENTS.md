# 2024-25 Best Practices Implementation

This document outlines specific 2024-25 best practices research findings that should be implemented for modern production deployment. Items in `docs/planning/TODO.md` are excluded to avoid duplication.

## üîí Critical Security Improvements (2024-25 Standards)

### GitHub Webhooks Security (Industry Standard)

- [ ] **Webhook replay protection** - Use X-GitHub-Delivery header to prevent duplicate processing
- [ ] **Event type validation** - Validate X-GitHub-Event header before processing

### Slack API Security (2024-25 Updates)

- [ ] **Rate limiting compliance** - Respect Slack's updated rate limits (conversations.history changes May 2025)
- [ ] **Proper retry logic** - Handle transient Slack API failures with exponential backoff

### Google Cloud Security (2024-25 Features)

- [ ] **Firestore security rules** - Implement client-side access controls
- [ ] **Automatic security updates** - Enable Cloud Run managed security updates

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations (2024-25 Standards)

### Firestore Performance (Google's 2024-25 Recommendations)

- [ ] **500/50/5 traffic ramping** - Follow Google's recommended scaling pattern for new collections

### Container Security (2024-25 Docker Best Practices)

- [ ] **Distroless images** - Switch from Alpine to distroless for smaller attack surface
- [ ] **Multi-stage build optimization** - Reduce final image size by 60%+ as recommended
- [ ] **Regular vulnerability scanning** - Integrate Trivy or similar in CI/CD pipeline

## üìä Modern Observability (2024-25 Standards)

### Structured Logging Enhancement

- [ ] **Extend trace ID usage** - Use trace IDs in all service calls
- [ ] **Cloud Logging integration** - Leverage Google Cloud's structured logging
- [ ] **Request/response logging** - Log webhook payloads (sanitized) for debugging

### Monitoring & Alerting

- [ ] **Webhook processing metrics** - Track processing times and success rates
- [ ] **Error rate monitoring** - Alert on increased error rates
- [ ] **Business metrics** - Track PR notification success rates

## üèóÔ∏è Modern Architecture Patterns (2024-25 Go Best Practices)

### Reliability Patterns

- [ ] **Timeout configurations** - Proper timeouts for all external API calls
- [ ] **Health checks with dependencies** - Include Firestore and Slack API health
