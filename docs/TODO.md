## üîÑ Refactoring Opportunities

### Code Structure
- [ ] **Architectural improvements**
  - Separate business logic from HTTP handlers
  - Implement dependency injection container
  - Add interface abstractions for external services
  - Consider hexagonal architecture pattern

### Configuration Management
- [ ] **Environment-specific configs**
  - Support for multiple environments (dev/staging/prod)
  - Configuration validation at startup
  - Hot-reload of non-sensitive configuration
  - Secrets management integration

## üêõ Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Current Limitations
- [ ] **Message tracking limitations**
  - No handling of deleted/edited PR descriptions
  - Missing support for force-pushed PRs
  - No cleanup of old message records
  - Limited error recovery for failed Slack messages

### Performance Considerations
- [ ] **Scalability concerns**
  - Single-threaded webhook processing
  - No caching for frequently accessed data
  - Potential memory leaks in long-running processes
  - Database query optimization needed

## üìä Observability & Debugging

### Monitoring
- [ ] **Add comprehensive observability**
  - Structured logging with correlation IDs
  - Metrics for webhook processing times
  - Distributed tracing for request flows
  - Error tracking and alerting

### Debugging Tools

  - Admin endpoints for manual operations
  - Configuration validation tools

## üéØ Future Integrations

### External Services
- [ ] **Additional integrations**
  - Support for other Git providers (GitLab, Bitbucket)
  - Integration with other chat platforms (Discord, Teams)
  - Webhook forwarding to other services
  - Integration with project management tools

### Extensibility
- [ ] **Plugin architecture**
  - Support for custom notification formats
  - Pluggable authentication providers
  - Custom webhook processors
  - Template engine for messages

## üìù Notes

### Lessons Learned
- **Linting configuration**: Start with `enable-all` and disable selectively rather than enabling specific linters
- **Error handling**: Always handle errors properly; use sentinel errors instead of `nil, nil` returns
- **Security**: Add timeouts to HTTP servers and validate all inputs
- **Documentation**: Add package comments and exported function documentation from the start
- **Testing**: Set up testing infrastructure early to catch issues during development

### Best Practices Identified
- Use structured logging with context
- Implement graceful shutdown patterns
- Add comprehensive error wrapping
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Separate business logic from HTTP handlers
- Add proper observability from the beginning

### Technical Decisions to Review
- **Firestore vs PostgreSQL**: Consider if relational database might be better for complex queries
- **Gin vs stdlib**: Evaluate if we need the extra dependencies
- **Monolith vs microservices**: Current approach is appropriate for MVP, but consider splitting as features grow
- **Polling vs webhooks**: Current webhook approach is correct, but consider backup polling for reliability
