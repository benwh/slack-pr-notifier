    PR mirroring and status reactions between GitHub and Slack
  long_description: >
    PR Bot provides seamless integration between GitHub and Slack with two key features: PR mirroring (automatically posts PR notifications to Slack when opened, including manual link detection) and PR status reactions (syncs emoji reactions for reviews and closures). Supports per-repository channel configuration and reaction synchronization across all PR instances.
